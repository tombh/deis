# If you want to do some funky custom stuff to your box, but don't want those things tracked by git,
# add a Vagrantfile.local and it will be included. You can use the exact same syntax as above. For
# example you could mount your dev version of deis onto the VM and hack live on the VM;
# `config.vm.share_folder "deis", "/opt/deis", "~/myworkspace/deis"
# Or if you're low on RAM you can boot the VM with less RAM. Note that at least 1GB is needed for
# installation, but you may be able to get with 512MB once everything is installed.
