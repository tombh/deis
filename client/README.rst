What is Deis?
-------------

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and scale LXC
containers and Chef nodes used to host applications, databases, middleware
and other services. Deis leverages Chef, Docker and Heroku Buildpacks to
provide a private PaaS that is lightweight and flexible.

Deis comes with out-of-the-box support for Ruby, Python, Node.js, Java,
Clojure, Scala, Play, PHP, Perl, Dart and Go. However, Deis can deploy
anything using Heroku Buildpacks, Docker images or Chef recipes. Deis is
designed to work with any cloud provider. Currently Amazon EC2 and Rackspace
Cloud are supported.


Why Deis?
=========

Deploy anything
---------------

Deploy a wide range of languages and frameworks with a simple git push
using Heroku Buildpacks or Dockerfiles. Use custom Chef layers to deploy
databases, middleware and other add-on services.


Control everything
------------------

Choose your hosting provider configuration. Define a formation with your
own proxy and runtime layers. Retain full root access to every node.
Manage your platform with a private Deis controller.


Scale effortlessly
------------------

Scale nodes and containers with a single command. Node provisioning,
container balancing and proxy reconfiguration are completely automated.


100% Open Source
----------------

Free, transparent and easily customized. Join the open-source PaaS
and DevOps community by using Deis and complimentary projects like
Docker, Chef and Heroku Buildpacks.


Getting Started
---------------

Installing the Deis client using `pip`_ is simple::

    $ pip install deis

`pip`_ will automatically install the following dependencies:

-  `docopt <http://docopt.org>`__
-  `pyyaml <https://bitbucket.org/xi/pyyaml>`__
-  `requests <http://python-requests.org>`__

You should know the fully-qualified domain name of an existing
Deis controller. To set up a Deis controller, see the
`Installation`_ documentation.

Registration will discover SSH keys automatically and use the
`standard environment variables`_ to configure the EC2 provider.

.. code-block:: console

    $ deis register http://my-deis-controller.fqdn
    username: myuser
    password:
    password (confirm):
    email: myuser@example.com
    Registered myuser
    Logged in as myuser

    Found the following SSH public keys:
    1) id_rsa.pub
    Which would you like to use with Deis? 1
    Uploading /Users/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to Deis... done

Find an application youâ€™d like to deploy, or clone `an example app`_.

Change into the application directory and use ``deis formations:create`` to
initialize a new formation in a specific cloud region. For example:

.. code-block:: console

  $ deis formations:create dev1 --flavor=rackspace-dfw

Use the ``deis nodes:scale`` command to provision nodes that will be
dedicated to this formation.

Then create an application that references the formation.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd <my-application-repo>
    $ deis create --formation=dev1
    Creating application... done, created nimbus-pamphlet
    Git remote deis added

Use ``git push deis master`` to deploy your application.

Deis will automatically deploy Docker containers and configure Nginx proxies
to route requests to your application.

.. code-block:: console
